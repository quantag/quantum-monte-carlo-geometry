# quantum-monte-carlo-geometry
Reproducible demonstration of geometric quantum amplitude estimation for Monte Carlo post-processing.  The repository contains a single, self-contained script that compares naive sampling and a geometric  (amplitude-amplification-based) estimator for rare-event probability estimation, and generates the  figures used in the accompanying article.
